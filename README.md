# CodeAssistant

CodeAssistant is a C# web application that utilizes OpenAI's GPT to refactor users' pieces of code. This project is built with ASP.NET Core and uses Entity Framework Core for object-relational mapping.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- [.NET 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)
- An appropriate IDE such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the C# extension, or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).

## Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/garikisraelyan/CodeAssistant.git
cd CodeAssistant
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

For Unix-based systems:
```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```

For Windows CMD:
```cmd
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

For Windows PowerShell:
```ps
$Env:OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```

Replace `'your_api_key_here'` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Installation of Required Libraries
